Custom metrics are user-defined metrics created in the Lightdash UI that aren't part of the dbt model definitions. These are stored separately and can be used in charts and dashboards.

Returns:
- Custom metric definitions
- SQL expressions used to calculate them
- Associated tables/explores
- Labels and descriptions

**When to use:**
- To discover custom business metrics created by analysts
- To understand what custom calculations are available
- Before using a custom metric in a chart or query

**Note:** These are different from metrics defined in your dbt models.""",
